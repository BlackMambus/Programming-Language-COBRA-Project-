# Programming-Language-COBRA-Project-

A programming language is a formal system of communication used to instruct computers to perform specific tasks. It's a blend of syntax (rules) and semantics (meaning) that allows developers to write software, automate operations, manipulate data, and build interactive applications.

ðŸ§  Core Concepts:
Syntax: Defines how code is writtenâ€”like grammar for machines.

Semantics: Interprets what those instructions mean and how they affect the system.

Compilation vs Interpretation: Some languages convert code into machine-readable format before execution (e.g., C++), while others interpret code on-the-fly (e.g., Python).

ðŸ§° Key Features:
Abstraction: Simplifies complex operations through reusable functions or modules.

Control Structures: Includes loops, conditionals, and flow-control statements.

Data Handling: Supports variables, data types, and structures to manage information.

Extensibility: Allows integration with libraries, frameworks, and APIs.
